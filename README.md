# NameSurfer
I initially taught myself to code by watching Stanford University's online lectures for their course CS106: [Programming Methodologies](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1194/assn/nameSurfer.html).

The [assignment](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1194/assn/nameSurfer.html) that I enjoyed the most was called **Name Surfer**, in which your program reads a database of Baby Name rankings over the last 100 years.  The user can enter a name, perhaps their own name, and see a simple chart of how their name has risen/fallen in popularity over the last century.  I enjoyed this assignment because I got to see a lot of programming concepts come together into a visual application that was fun to interact with.

## Most Similar Names
Once completing the assignment, I decided to modify it to graph what I call the _most similar names_. The user enters a name, and the modified program scours the database and calculates the **most correlated** names to the one entered.  The user sees a graph of the names that have had the most similar popularity trajectories to the one that they entered.

## ACM
Note that at the time the course used [Java Task Force](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/) packages made available in the `acm.jar` file.
